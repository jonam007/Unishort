"LocationDetails": "Located in Fredericton and Saint John areas of New Brunswick, UNB provides a diverse experience to its students. The Fredericton campus is situated on a hill, overlooking the Saint John River. This campus is known for its colorful outlook and Georgian style buildings. Few of the buildings on campus were designed by the famous architect: Ernest Fairweather in the early 90s: the Old Civil Engineering Building and Gymnasium. The Convocation Hall was also designed by another famous architect. The campus has a War Memorial and a Centre for the Study of War and Society. The Old Arts Building and an Observatory on campus are two of the buildings recognized as the National Historic Sites. The St. John Campus, located in Tucker Park, several kilometers from the city's business center, this one is comparatively smaller. It has the view of Kennebecasis River and Grand Bay. A subject of novelty is the\u00a0Hans W. Klohn Commons here, which is Canada's most environment-friendly building. It is also home to New Brunswick's largest hospital and a medical school. Both campuses have world-class athletic facilities such as fitness classes and outdoor activities such as kayaking.",
"Residing": "A noteworthy difference between the Fredericton campus and the Saint John campus is that most students in the former live on-campus while the latter is more of a commuter campus. Saint John is in a rather remote location and hence one can't live near the campus. There are 13 available residences in Fredericton and 2 in St. John. A few years back, one of the residences at Fredericton was chosen as one of the most partying halls of North America.",
