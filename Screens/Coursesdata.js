Astrophysics has two sibling sciences viz. Astronomy and Cosmology, and the lines in between them often blur. But Astrophysics as a discipline is more associated with the physical theories and properties of the celestial bodies. Thus, it ventures beyond mere observation of positions or motions of planets and stars in space into the nature of the astronomical objects. Astrophysicists are at the forefront of the research and study to understand the universe and its constituent bodies like stars, planets, galaxies and other celestial objects. Students who find themselves interested in discovering and investigating changes in space and the properties of different celestial bodies can consider taking up Astrophysics for their undergraduation. The Bachelor\u2019s program will provide a headstart to those looking to develop a career in this field. Also, you can explore the field as a whole and get to know the about subsets of the domain, in which you can then choose to specialise later. Astrophysics, as a professional field, demands a robust knowledge base and research methods, and pursuing a bachelor\u2019s program can help you develop the same.",

It is an academic discipline where people who study it are perpetually engaged in asking, answering, and arguing for their answers to life's most basic questions. It could be said to be a love for garnering wisdom. According to the Department of Philosophy at Florida State University, Philosophy is an activity people undertake when they seek to understand fundamental truths about themselves, the world in which they live, and their relationships to the world and each other. The ultimate aim of philosophy is complete liberty of mind, independence of any prejudice, morality, freedom, and to answer 'what is it all about? Who am I? There are very few people who are satisfied with the identity they accord themselves, and fewer people who can actually answer that question. Knowing more about Philosophy will certainly take one step closer to the answer, as this is what a philosopher does. Seeking new information, amassing knowledge, and learning every day is a philosopher's work. From a career point of view, Philosophy will prepare you for law, religion, business, international diplomacy, social work and writing. It takes one basic answer for the most difficult question. If the cryptic sentences bother you, you better rethink your major or you can consider the Bachelor\u2019s in Philosophy.",

Materials engineering shows us how to apply knowledge to make better things and how to make things better. Materials science and engineering drives innovation in both research and industry in fields ranging from aerospace to medicine.",

It is the building block for everything in our daily lives, including mobile devices, architecture, art, money, engineering, and even sports. It is the branch of science which deals with the logic of shape, quantity and arrangement. Since it can be combined easily with serious study in another subject in the physical, biological, or social sciences by means of a double major or otherwise, this major works well for both professionals and non-professionals.",
